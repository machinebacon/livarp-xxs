livarp-xxs aka the tiny livarp..

What about building your own Debian system ?
  livarp-xxs is here for you:

  livarp-xxs provide an ultra-minimal environment,
  it allows you to build your own Debian system nearly from scratch:

  - base system     : Debian Squeeze, the Stable release
  - login           : startx, the basic one
  - window-manager  : TWM, the original one
  - file-manager    : MidnightCommander, the classic one
  - editors         : nano & vim
  - navigator       : lynx, the bugfree one
  - package-manager : aptitude, the cli one
  - monitoring      : htop, xosview & conky
  - system          : 
  - gtk/utils       : none ... "nearly from scratch".... :)

no automounting, no wireless gui suport, no 3D effects, no sudo group....
    livarp-xxs is here to let you install only what YOU want
    - with a minimal impact on your system,
    - with some utils to help you get out the TTY :)

livarp-xxs is an advanced-users oriented distro but can be a good start for a middle-user too..
if you are new to GNU/Linux, prefer a conventionnal distro like Linux Mint, CrunchBang Linux or SalixOS (or maybe livarp*regular)

happy building :)
